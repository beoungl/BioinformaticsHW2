# BioinformaticsHW2

For the answers for hw2, just run the python program and it will automatically print out the result.
It first prints out the possibility of createing random kmer for x length, then prints out whether randomly generated kmer is in the aligner file or not.
Kmer is randomly generated every time the program is ran, so the kmer will differ every time the program is ran.
